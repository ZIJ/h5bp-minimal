My fork of the famous [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Best for heavy-js cutting-edge web apps

Changes from original h5bp:
- removed docs, icons, 404 and some other stuff
- removed Google Analytics
- removed Modernizr and even html5shiv
- removed CDN script links
- jQuery updated to 2.0.0 + dev version
