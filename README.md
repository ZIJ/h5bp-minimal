My fork of the famous [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Has some changes for my daily development in a clone-and-go style:
- removed docs, icons, 404 and other stuff
- removed Google Analytics
- changed script links to local
- modernizr replaced with html5shiv
- dev versions of scripts
