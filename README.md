My fork of the famous [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Best for heavy-js cutting-edge web apps

Has some changes for my daily development in a clone-and-go style:
- removed docs, icons, 404 and other stuff
- removed Google Analytics
- removed Modernizr and even html5shiv
- modernizr replaced with html5shiv
- dev versions of scripts
